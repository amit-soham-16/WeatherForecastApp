## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
* **Maven** (for Spring Boot project management)
* **A text editor or IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse)
* **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amit-soham-16/WeatherForecastApp.git
    cd WeatherForecastApp
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `WeatherForecastApp` with your actual repository name if it's different, e.g., `QuizGame-` if you reused the repo for weather app too.)*

2.  **Obtain an API Key:**
    * This application relies on an external weather API. You'll need to sign up for a free API key from [mention the API provider's website, e.g., OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
    * Once you have your API key, create a new file named `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) in `src/main/resources` folder (if it doesn't exist) and add your API key like this:
        ```properties
        # application.properties
        weather.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
        *(Adjust the property name `weather.api.key` if your Spring Boot code uses a different one for the API key.)*

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage



Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
